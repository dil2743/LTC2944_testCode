# LTC2944_testCode
The  LTC2944  is  a  battery  gas  gauge  designed  for  use with multicell batteries with terminal voltages from 3.6V to 60V. It measures battery charge and discharge, battery voltage, current and its own temperature. A  precision  analog  coulomb  counter  integrates  current through  a  sense  resistor  between  the  battery’s  positive terminal and the load or charger. Battery voltage, battery current  and  silicon  temperature  are  measured  with  an internal ADC.
